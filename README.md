# customObjectsVHubDbSample

This repo was created as part of workshop showcasing how to use HubDB and Custom Objects to create dynamic pages in the HubSpot CMS. The original presentation was [recorded](https://my.demio.com/recording/hjJi4sEA).

This workshop and codebase took advantage of beta features. You can request access to them at [this page](https://developers.hubspot.com/private-betas) if you'd like to try this out on your own.
